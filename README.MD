# TweetGrabber
**Grab and easily save up to 100 tweets from a Twitter account!**

With TweetGrabber, you simply provide the username (aka the @) for the Twitter account for whom you want to fetch/save Tweets from, and the name of the text or CSV file that the Tweets should be saved to.
It's that easy!

**Usage**

Install repo via terminal as shown below, or just download.
```
git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
```
Then, create an app in the Twitter Developer Portal, and add the bearer token in 'auth_info.py.' That's it for the setup! Now, run get_tweets.py, and when prompted, input the Twitter account username and the file destination. You can enter multiple usernames, each separated by a comma and no whitespace. Also, if you don't care about the filenames, you can leave that input prompt blank, and the filenames will be automatically generated.
```
python3 get_tweets.py
```
The file 'trumptweets.txt' is an example file which was generated by fetching Tweets from 'realDonaldTrump.' The file is generated using Pandas, and can be easily read in as a DataFrame.

**Notes**
- You must have a Twitter Developer Account, and modify 'auth_info.py' with the bearer token. I'm looking to add the ability to fetch Tweets without having to create a developer account, but for now, one is needed.
- Only required packages are Pandas and Requests
